                        <strong> 5 players who never hit a six in their ODI career</strong>
                        <p>
                            In One Day International (ODI) cricket, a batsman needs to be rich with the skill and temperament while using his 
                            willow against some quality bowlers. Another essential aspect in ODI batting is the ability to smash boundaries, 
                            especially sixes in order to score quick runs. Many batsmen who have excelled in the run-making process have been a 
                            power hitter as well as some situations required to add runs on the board in a swift manner.
                            In the vast history of ODI cricket, there have been quite a few players who smashed more than 100 sixes in their careers, 
                            however, there also have been some players who failed to hit a single six in their career.

                        <strong> Africa hopeful of India's visit for a T20I series in August</strong>
                        <p>
                            South Africa are hopeful that India will tour near the end of August to mark the resumption of cricket in the country 
                            in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic. The plan is for the teams to contest three T20Is behind closed doors, possibly 
                            in a sanitised accommodation, training and playing bio-bubble. Perhaps not coincidentally, it seems Sourav Ganguly can 
                            count on South Africa's backing should he consider a bid for the ICC presidency.

                            As many of you may already be aware, all the modern browsers are discontinuing support for Flash player 
                            towards the end of 2020. The effect of this on CricketWeb is that the following functions of the site will no 
                            longer work and will be decommissioned when this occurs.
                            This marks a sad end to the CW Cricket software that had a project team of 18 people across CricketWeb and our 
                            friends at PlanetCricket and was over a year in the making. CW Cricket has had 1,967,415 games played to date since 
                            its launch in 2009 and many tens of thousands of the other games played also.

                        <strong> women: India & South Africa tri-series an option - Clare Connor</strong>
                        <p>
                            England's women could host a tri-series featuring India and South Africa later this summer, according to director of cricket
                             Clare Connor.
                            India's tour, scheduled for June and July, was postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, while South Africa are due 
                            to travel in September."We're optimistic of holding at least one series," Connor told BBC Sport. "It could be that we play the two series concurrently and look at a tri-series. Everything is possible."
                            England's men began training this week and the women are planning a return on about 22 June.

                            When one thinks about T20 cricket, Chris Gayle comes to mind. Much has been expected of Chris Gayle 
                            right throughout his career, but he has looked at expectation as an opportunity to wow rather than 
                            a threat of disappointing people. Over the course of his 404-game career, taking him right around 
                            the globe (19 franchises), Gayle has ammassed the most runs (13,296), the most centuries (22. No one 
                            else has 10) and has 978 sixes to his name (next best is 652). The Undisputed GOAT.
